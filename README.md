# Neural Network Suite

* Fine-tuning
* LoRA
* RAG

Each application should output the duration of each iteration and respond to
SIGTERM and SIGINT by flushing output if necessary, before exiting.

## Fine-tuning

* Llama 3.1 8B
* Hugging Face Transformers

## Low-rank Adaptation

To demonstrate LoRA, we serve SDXL 1.0 base as well as the LCM.

* OpenAI Images API

## Retrieval Augmented Generation

* LangChain
* Hugging Face embeddings
* In-memory vector store
* Connects to a separate OpenAI server for generation
* OpenAI Completions API
